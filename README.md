# obsidian-publish-css
My Obsidian Publish CSS document for huntingforteeth.com

Basically, ripped from https://github.com/chad-bennett/obsidian-publish-css, but I found it weirdly broken.
I have made a bunch of changes to get it to match his actual website, and then made some of my own modifications to customise it.
